# My Greatest Fear
###### by Griffin

My greatest fear well is an IDEs with no dark mode and semicolons. Well, I hate semicolons because **always** forget them and depending on the language you can get some hard-to-read errors. Why I'm scared of IDEs with no dark itâ€™s because bugs are attracted to light.
